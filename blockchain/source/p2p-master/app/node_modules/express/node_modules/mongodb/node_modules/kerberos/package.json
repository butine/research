  "readme": "Kerberos\n========\n\nThe `kerberos` package is a C++ extension that requires a build environment to be installed on your system. You must be able to build node.js itself to be able to compile and install the `kerberos` module. Furthermore the `kerberos` module requires the MIT Kerberos package to correctly compile on UNIX operating systems. Consult your UNIX operation system package manager what libraries to install.\n\n{{% note class=\"important\" %}}\nWindows already contains the SSPI API used for Kerberos authentication. However you will need to install a full compiler tool chain using visual studio C++ to correctly install the kerberos extension.\n{{% /note %}}\n\n### Diagnosing on UNIX\n\nIf you don’t have the build essentials it won’t build. In the case of linux you will need gcc and g++, node.js with all the headers and python. The easiest way to figure out what’s missing is by trying to build the kerberos project. You can do this by performing the following steps.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/christkv/kerberos.git\ncd kerberos\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf all the steps complete you have the right toolchain installed. If you get node-gyp not found you need to install it globally by doing.\n\n```\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nIf correctly compiles and runs the tests you are golden. We can now try to install the kerberos module by performing the following command.\n\n```\ncd yourproject\nnpm install kerberos --save\n```\n\nIf it still fails the next step is to examine the npm log. Rerun the command but in this case in verbose mode.\n\n```\nnpm --loglevel verbose install kerberos\n```\n\nThis will print out all the steps npm is performing while trying to install the module.\n\n### Diagnosing on Windows\n\nA known compiler tool chain known to work for compiling `kerberos` on windows is the following.\n\n* Visual Studio c++ 2010 (do not use higher versions)\n* Windows 7 64bit SDK\n* Python 2.7 or higher\n\nOpen visual studio command prompt. Ensure node.exe is in your path and install node-gyp.\n\n```\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nNext you will have to build the project manually to test it. Use any tool you use with git and grab the repo.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/christkv/kerberos.git\ncd kerberos\nnpm install\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\nThis should rebuild the driver successfully if you have everything set up correctly.\n\n### Other possible issues\n\nYour python installation might be hosed making gyp break. I always recommend that you test your deployment environment first by trying to build node itself on the server in question as this should unearth any issues with broken packages (and there are a lot of broken packages out there).\n\nAnother thing is to ensure your user has write permission to wherever the node modules are being installed.\n",
